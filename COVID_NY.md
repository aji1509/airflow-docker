## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Two dags named NY_COVID_INITIAL_LD and LOAD_NY_COVID_DLY will help us get historical and ongoing daily loads from New York Covid testing data.

## üßê Objective <a name = "objective"></a>
The objective here is to get NY Covid testing data for all counties and persist the data in a database. Each county to have its own table. The task should execute at a specific time everyday and populate the tables.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Clone this repo to your machine and follow the instructions under [Usage](#usage)


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

- Clone the Repo

```
git clone
```

- Start docker build

```
docker-compose up --detached
```

- Keep checking docker processes to make sure all machines are helthy

```
docker ps
```

- Once you notice that all containers are healthy. Access Airflow UI

```
http://localhost:8080
```

- Edit the postgres_default connection from the UI or through command line if you want to persist data in postgres as part of the dags you create. Even better you can always add a new connection. 


```
  ./airflow.sh bash 

  airflow connections add 'postgres_new' --conn-uri 'postgres://airflow:airflow@postgres:5432/airflow'

  connect to postgres and create new database with name 'userdata'

  ```

## üéà Airflow DAG Details <a name="dag"></a>

*   Activate the DAG NY_COVID_INITIAL_LD. What does it do?
    *   Created tables for all 62 counties in New York in Postgres under database userdata.
    *   Creates function and trigger in postgres to auto-populate the all the 62 counties with their data.
    *   Makes a call to NY Health API and gets data in json.
    *   Loads this json data to Postgres table.

*   The next day activate the Dag : LOAD_NY_COVID_DLY. What does it do?
    *   Gets execution date from Airflow context
    *   Calls the NY Helath API with that date and saves result in json.
    *   Loads this data to Postgres table.

## Airflow Concepts Used <a name = "concepts"></a>

*   TaskGroups
    *   To create all the county tables
*   Task Flow Api
    *   Using Task Flow with classic operators.
*   Airflow Macros
    *   To get the execution date in the Daily DAG.

## ‚úçÔ∏è ToDo <a name = "Todo"></a> 
*   The Objective can be achieved by just one daily dag and using backfill and catchup.
*   Explore the new rest Api of Airflow
    *   Maybe implement rest api test framework using RestAssured :)
*   Implement Audit jobs or explore greatexpectations operator.
